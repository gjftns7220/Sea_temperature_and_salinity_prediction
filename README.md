# Spatio-temporal Forecast on Sea Temperature and Salinity - Best Innovative Design Winner Solution

Hi, this is a Spatio-temporal Forecast on Sea Temperature and Salinity Best Innovative Design Winner solution for
Ocean of Data Challenge by DeepSense research team of Dalhousie University
The Ocean of Data Challenge by DeepSense, Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) and partners, engaged Canadian post-secondary students in creating innovative machine learning solutions using ocean data to understand various oceanic aspects.
The competition included 240 students registered, and 10 different post-secondary schools across Canada represented that span from Nov 1 to Nov 20 - 2023.

**Project Objective**

Our project focused on time-series forecasting of Ocean temperature and Salinty predictions to analyze oceanic sea diversity until the end of 2050.

Our area of focus relied on 

Longitude: from -140° to -122°
Latitude: from 45° to 55°
Depth: from 0 to 500 meters
Temperature: from -3° to 20° Celsius

Salinity: from 20 to 40 PSU (Practical Salinity Units)
with 'IOS Rosette Bottle Data' and 'Vertical profiles of seawater properties measured by Conductivity-Temperature-Depth loggers in British Columbia, Canada, 1965 to present' dataset that is available on [CIOOS datahub](https://explore.cioos.ca/?lang=en)
