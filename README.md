# Spatio-temporal Forecast on Sea Temperature and Salinity - Best Innovative Design Winner Solution

Welcome to the GitHub repository showcasing our Best Innovative Design winning solution for the Ocean of Data Challenge – Coast to Coast to Coast, a collaborative effort by DeepSense, the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS), and various partners. As a proud participant from the University of Alberta, I am excited to present my innovative machine-learning approach tailored for forecasting sea temperature and salinity.

**Project Objective**

Our project focused on time-series forecasting of Ocean temperature and Salinty predictions to analyze oceanic sea diversity until the end of 2050.

Our area of focus relied on 

Longitude: from -140° to -122°  
Latitude: from 45° to 55°  
Depth: from 0 to 500 meters  
Temperature: from -3° to 20° Celsius  
Salinity: from 20 to 40 PSU (Practical Salinity Units)  

with 'IOS Rosette Bottle Data' and 'Vertical profiles of seawater properties measured by Conductivity-Temperature-Depth loggers in British Columbia, Canada, 1965 to present' dataset that is available on [CIOOS datahub](https://explore.cioos.ca/?lang=en)
